This installation program owes its existence to Ma, to barda and to the people at http://sourceforge.net/projects/nsis/ 
I made the installer thinking of all the trouble Ma had trying to install the program on her machine.
Barda gave me the kick needed to start me on this endevour
The people at http://sourceforge.net/projects/nsis/ enabled a quick and pleasant end to the endevour.

The Lekho installer has been tested on the following windows platforms and works
a) Windows XP
b) WinNT
c) Win98

1.
If you get an error with something to do with the "fonts" click ignore - the installer tries to install the fonts and if the fonts are already there and currently under use this error is generated. It is harmless.

2. 
After installing goto settings->control panel->fonts and click open the fonts folder.
For some reason this refreshes the font list immediately, and lets you work with Lekho 
right away

3. 
The installer associates the extentions .bng with Lekho. If you don't want this deselect the option during installation.
Subhasish Mazumdar suggested this feature. The .bng file icons will only change after a while/after a logout, but double clicking on them will open them in Lekho right away.

4. 
I used the NullSoft installer from http://sourceforge.net/projects/nsis/ 
If you think the windows installer is easy to use please drop both them and me a line. I think they did a great job !
