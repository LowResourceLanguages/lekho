Bugs are put here, when they are squished they are removed and sent to CHANGES

0. The bangla unicode specs are in lfux. Namely the coding specs for
a)  a-jawphola-akar
b)  ra-jawphola
c)  khanda-ta and ta-y-hashanto
are under debate.
For case c) Lekho follows Andy White's proposal. For the other two Lekho goes by current Unicode specs.
These should not normally pose a problem.

1. typing NNG (onushor) but stopping halfway i.e. NN and the hitting arrow or backspace causes a screwup, this is due to flushBangla not working right with an empty partial code
