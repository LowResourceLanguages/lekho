v1.15
2002.12.27
1. Now spellcheck replaces and find and replace ops are also covered by undo/redo

2002.12.26
1. YEEEHAH ! Implemented redo/undo. Seems to work bug free (TM) but needs further testing(TM)[small bug in deleting, found and fixed almost immediately]
2. Added "i" ending rule to the grammatical normalisation
3. added flushBangla to the paste functions
4. fixed bug in drawContents that caused segfault if you resized the window fast enough (neg values to drawing area....)
5. Implemented greying out of undo/redo buttons if no undo/redo available
6. Killed bug in redo (deleting one less char than needed)

2002.12.25
1. Spell checker now uses "compressed files" to speed up loading and economize on space
2. Uses dummy files through out the bangla range to prevent "file not found messages" 

2002.12.24
1. improved spell checker so that it now implements "grammatical normalisation"

2002.12.15
1. changed bangtex.txt such that onnushor now appears as {h} avoids complications with 't'

2002.12.05
1. Modifying document causes a * to appear in the window caption...

v1.1
2002.12.03
1. Played with print function to make margins 10% of the page dimension for linux. All fixed for windows as usual. Lekho isn't designed to produce pretty printouts - its designed to produce functional ones..

2002.12.02
1. YES ! Hacked print function to work (sort of) in windows.
However the font size is fixed as are the margins, and you can't print to file (which is a QT issue, if you have win QT 3.0 maybe it works !)
2. Fixed oversight in screenFont (BanglaTextEdit.cpp) that messed up newlines.. 

2002.12.01
1. Enabled spell checker...

2002.11.16
1. Enabled double buffering to remove flicker during typing
2. Corrected insidous bug (bangla.h, BanglaCR) that sent a \n as screenFont. This was only discovered when I turned wordwrap off and saw the effects (since turning word wrap off returns the whole line, which includes a bangla CR if the line is English - look at the code for paintLine in BanglaTextEdit)
3. Refined scroll to cursor code
4. Enabled keymap display feature

2002.11.09
1. Fixed bug in multiline insert (BanglaDocument::insert)
2. Added screen font code for ra-hashanto
3. Windows version of Lekho now has icon too
4. added screen font code for ontosto jay-e reph

2002.11.08
1. Made icon and logo for lekho - pretty cool :) 

2002.11.07
1. fixed bug in BanglaDocument.cpp for multi line deletes...

2002.11.04
1. Fixed bug in BanglaTextEdit.cpp in keyboard event handler that didn't take into account buffered input for english

2002.11.02
1. lekho now accepts commandline arguments to mean files which it opens in new windows - Barda's suggestion.

2002.10.31
1. Fixed bug in changing screen font that didn't handle tabs
2. Modified shor.txt so that by typing * in front of a kar you can now type in a kar that hangs alone...


****
1. save as html and save as utf16 added to file options. Utf16 is self explanatory, save as html basically adds on some html tags like <br> to line ends and some default headers, its useful for me because I can type up a bangla page in plain text and save it as a moderately passable webpage as is.

2. in the export to screen font there is an option to not use automatic headers (see point 1). This means you can type up a webpage in bangla unicode (writing your own headers) and export it to screenfont and Lekho won't add an automatic header to the file if you tell it not to. 

3. Fixed delete bangtex bug in destructor of BanglaTextEdit. Destructor no longer tries to delete bangtex if it hasn't been allocated

2002.10.15
3. Fixed bug in segmenting that didn't take into account jawphola for a

4. Added section in segmenting to take into account chondrobindu after kar

5. Modified shor.txt to input a-jawphola-akar and a-jawphola-akar-chondrobindu

2002.10.02
1. Added html export
2. expanded adarshalipi.txt
3. added bangtex support !
