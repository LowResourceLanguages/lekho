All changes referenced to v1.0

v1.1
1. save as html and save as utf16 added to file options. Utf16 is self explanatory, save as html basically adds on some html tags like <br> to line ends and some default headers, its useful for me because I can type up a bangla page in plain text and save it as a moderately passable webpage as is.

2. in the export to screen font there is an option to not use automatic headers (see point 1). This means you can type up a webpage in bangla unicode (writing your own headers) and export it to screenfont and Lekho won't add an automatic header to the file if you tell it not to.
