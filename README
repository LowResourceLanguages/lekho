REQUIREMENTS

In order for Lekho to run you need
  The executable for your OS and processor
  The bangla true type fonts AdarshaLipiXXX (Without these fonts, you can still type bangla, but you won't see it correctly on Lekho. It will save correctly.)
  An initialisation file .lekhorc
  Three files related to the transliteration rules, and one file related to the Adarshalipi font
All these files (except the fonts)are bundled together into one package for the version you want to download. The fonts are available as part of the "required" package

In addition, the following window specific requirements must be met:
  Windows : the msvcrt.dll and the qt-mt230nc.dll must be on your system
  Linux : QT version 2.3 or higher must be installed on your system
All these (except for the Linux QT package) are available from the downloads page.
QT for linux and windows is available from the trolltech website.

WINDOWS

Installing the executable:

      Download the executable package for the version you are interested in e.g. lekho_win_v1.0_2002.09.02.zip
      Download the fnts.zip file if you don't have the AdarshaLipi fonts
      Download the dlls.zip file if you don't have the required dlls
      Unzip the program package into a directory (if you keep the "use folder names" options on while extracting, if you are using winzip, the files
      unzip into e.g. Lekho\v1.0\bin)
      You should now have
      lekho.exe
      .lekhorc
      .lekho (start up files folder containing kar.txt, jukto.txt, shor.txt and adarshalipi.txt)
      examples ( a folder containing some example utf-8 bangla files) and
      fnts.zip (the zipped Adarshalipi fonts)
      Unzip the fnts.zip file and extract the three .ttf files you find into the folder where all the other files are (the exact location of the folder doesn't
      matter).
      Install these fonts by going to start->settings->control panel->fonts->file->install new font and then pointing the directory chooser that pops up
      to the directory where you unzipped the fonts (the installer will inform you if you already have the fonts).
      If you downloaded the dlls, unzip them into the same directory as the executable

That's it ! By double clicking on lekho.exe you should be ready to go. Take a look at the help.txt file by opening it up in lekho. help.html will render correctly
on ie6 if you have the usp10.dll (win98,2000,NT and XP) and James Kass' code2000 font.
If all else fails take a look at help_lipi.html, which just needs the adarshalipi fonts to be installed.

Compiling the executable:

      Install the QT 2.3 free windows version on your computer
      Download the source tarball for the required version. The source tarball is the same for linux and windows.
      Unzip the tarball using winzip to a directory. It should default to Lekho\v1.0\
      Generate a new QT project using the tmake utility and the Lekho.pro project file.
      If you have problems play a bit with the include directories etc.

LINUX

Compiling and installing:

      Ensure you have at least QT version 2.3 on your system. (QT is usually installed in /usr/lib/qtxx)
      Download the source tarball for the required version.
      Unzip and untar the package to a directory
      Go into the Lekho/v1.0/ directory and open up Makefile in a text editor
      Change the default installation and object directories on line 14 and 13 if you wish
      Let us call the installation directory Lekho_v1.0
      Type make
      Lekho should compile with some warnings.(I'll remove the warning causing code soon)
      Type make install (This copies some initialisation files to the install directory)
      Install the ttf fonts found in fnts.zip if they arn't on your system (If you use a recent window manager like KDE2, the system->configuration
      submenu should have tools do help you do this eg. kfontinst for KDE 2.
      Goto the Lekho_v1.0/bin directory and type ./lekho and lekho should run
      Open up the help.txt file found in the examples folder, or take a look at help.html in a unicode enabled browser. If your browser can't show
      the page correctly, read help_lipi.html which should render correctly in you have the adarshalipi fonts installed.

                                                    PERSONALISATION

PERSONALISING THE LOOK

The .lekhorc file contains information that Lekho uses when it starts up. 
You can mess with this (its in XML format) but Lekho now has dialogs that can do most of the configuring (from the menu item Options)


PERSONALISING THE ROMANISATION RULES

Take a look at the files in the .lekho/ directory. The files kar.txt, jukto.txt and shor.txt contain the romanisation rules. You need to keep a unicode chart for
bangla open by you as you change the first column of each entry in each file to suit you preferences for the transliteration rules. For instance to get the
"onnushor" symbol (рж) the default rule is you type "NNG"
You probably don't like that. So you open up the file "jukto.txt" and look at the relevant line, which is
NNG 1 0982
which tells Lekho that hitting NNG should insert the single unicode character 0x0982. You would like to use the keystroke "~" to do the job. Just change
the line to
~ 1 0982

CAUTION !!!!

When you are changing the romanisation rules you need to ensure that the first letter of any romanisation sequence in one file eg. in jukto.txt is not the
same as that in another file like shor.txt. If you violate this rule, then the results will be unexpected.
